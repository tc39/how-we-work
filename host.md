# How to host a TC39 meeting

TC39 hosts six in-person meetings a year. If you want to host a meeting, here's what is required:

## Prior to Meeting
1. Secure a meeting room and catering.
1. Note the meeting logistics in the TC39 Reflector -- address, where to park, how to get in, contact details, etc.
1. At least 2 weeks prior to the meeting, the ECMA secretariat will send a Doodle registration link to the reflector to determine an approximate attendee count.
1. Send the Doodle contacts to your registration desk so credentials can be printed early.
1. Remove any NDA signing requirements. This may be as simple as informing reception that NDAs are not required.
1. Reserve a restaurant for the social gathering. The day is flexible (either day 1 or day 2), and costs are shared with ECMA. Note that it is hard to actually get a room for 30+ people so getting started early is recommended.

## During the Meeting
1. Give a short presentation on the facilities - where to find the bathroom, how to use the WiFi, etc.

### Meeting Layout
1. A single-layered circle or square is ideal. Lecture-style seating is discouraged.
1. Power must be available at all seats. 
1. There must be an area for attendees to step away for phone calls or meetings.

### Meeting Food
1. Breakfast begins when people are filing in (typically 30-60 minutes prior to the meeting start).
1. Lunch begins at around 12:00pm.
1. Coffee & tea should be available throughout the day.
1. Drinks & snacks (snacks are optional but encouraged - the afternoon break at approximately 3pm is a hungry time)
1. Please be sensitive to dietary requirements. Vegan is required. Gathering dietary requirements via reflector is encouraged.

### Meeting Technology
1. Whiteboards and markers
1. Provide nametags. This helps note takers and new members. Pre-printed ones are not necessary. Attendees can fill out their own.
1. Some sort of telepresence/video conferencing system is required. Please ensure the system is in working order and you know how to use it.
