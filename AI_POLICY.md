# Use of LLMs and similar tools

Any contributions or comments must be your own writing, not the product of LLMs or other tools. Do not prompt an LLM to expand on or explain your idea and then post the output; just provide the idea itself.

Machine translation is permissible, including translation by an LLM, but your use of translation should not introduce any new content.

Similarly, you may use an LLM for proofreading as long as this doesn't add any new content.
