## Presentation Tips

- **Practice ahead of time.** If you're taking the time to champion a proposal, there's no doubt that you know your content and know it well. So make sure to communicate that knowledge by being prepared with what you want to say ahead of time.
- **Speak into the microphone.** We're a large group taking up large rooms, and microphones are no longer a luxury. Make sure everyone can hear what you have say.
- **Plan for questions.** Review your material for likely questions and try to answer them before they're asked. Chat with other delegates ahead of time to see what questions they commonly have. Leave time for discussion and questions at the end of your presentation. 
- **Expect some bikeshedding.** This is a group of people who are here _because of_ our opinions, and it's easy to wander into bikeshed territory when given the opportunity. One clever way to work around this is to identify ahead of time which trivial details are the most likely candidates for bikeshedding and create threads for them on the proposal's github repo. Point people to the issue threads to keep them on task during your allotted meeting time.
