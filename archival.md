# Archival of TC39 materials

It's important to preserve good records of TC39's decision-making process and reasons for technical decisions made. These records are useful when considering revisiting a decision, when making decisions in related areas, for historical purposes, and more. This page summarizes what's involved at a high level to make that happen.

## Meeting minutes

Rick Waldron is the coordinator and editor of TC39 meeting minutes.

At the start of each TC39 meeting, Rick creates the internal-only notes documents, based on a template he maintains. During the meeting, volunteers from TC39 take notes in these documents.

After the meeting, there is a week-long period where meeting delegates can edit notes, before it is passed back to Rick for final editing. Rick then sends the final notes to the Ecma Secretariat, who archives them.

### How to get involved

[Help take notes](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/master/how-to-take-notes.md) at TC39 committee meetings.

## Proposals repository

The [TC39 proposals repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) contains a list of active TC39 proposals. Jordan Harband maintains the repository, based on contributions from proposal champions and the community.

### How to get involved

Make PRs against the proposals repository to update the information there as things change.

## Archiving materials

TC39 has historically used a Bugzilla bug tracker and a wiki for collaboration, before transitioning to GitHub. Thomas Wood has [archived](https://tc39.github.io/archives/bugzilla/) the old bug tracker, and Dave Herman has [various archive versions](https://github.com/tc39/archives/issues/1) of the wiki, which otherwise is only available through the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20100701214135/http://wiki.ecmascript.org:80/doku.php?id=harmony:harmony).

### How to get involved

Fix one of the [open issues](https://github.com/tc39/archives/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) in the tc39/archives repository.

## Ecma archives

All materials are ultimately archived in Ecma's servers. If you are associated with an Ecma member, contact Istvan Sebestyen for the authentication information to access these archives.

### How to get involved

Ecma is currently lacking regular archives of TC39's GitHub presence. See [this issue](https://github.com/tc39/archives/issues/4) for details.
