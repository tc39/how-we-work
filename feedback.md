# How to give helpful feedback

Online and in person at TC39 meetings, we're always giving feedback on proposals. There are some suggestions for making sure that your feedback is actionable and helpful.

- Follow the TC39 [Code of Conduct](https://tc39.github.io/code-of-conduct/) in all proposal feedback
- Keep feedback respectful, constructive, and actionable.
- When you see a problem, explain the problem as much as possible.
    - Proposing a solution can be helpful, but sometimes jumping to and insisting on a particular solution can be counter-productive. Try to provide actionable feedback in terms of how to modify the current proposal when possible.
    - Explain concrete constraints are being broken are seen as a problem. Backwards compatibility being broken, a goal of the proposal being invalidated or unsatisfied, abstractions leaking state in potentially unseen ways, not complying with the object model, or preventing some future work due to semantics are examples of these. Try to be clear about what constraint is being broken and what can be done to fix it. Try to include explanation of why a constraint is important as some perspective's constraints may be mutually exclusive and cannot all be satisfied.
    - Lack of desirability from one perspective, does not cause a problem on its own. Try to concretely explain how the problem impacts the usability of the proposal itself or of other parts of the language. Keeping feedback actionable allows discussion on how to improve desirability and cohesion for the whole language.
    - Try to phrase any feedback of constraints such that they are actionable rather than preventing some specific design choice. Explain the concrete problem that is being caused by that choice rather than why a proposal should not make a specific choice of design. Presenting problems in terms of concrete impact is more likely to allow champions to directly address if they agree that something needs action.
    - Avoid bikeshedding unless requests for alternatives are made. Champions are open to feedback, but often time is required to investigate each choice for things such as ecosystem impact or web compatibility. Due to having many perspectives and allowing realistic time constraints, design choices may be made due to lack of problems from many perspectives rather than what one perspective prefers. Explain what designs different perspectives are seeking from a solution rather than if an individual solution is desirable or not.
- When you don't understand the motivation for a part of a proposal, one good strategy is to ask a question about it, rather than assuming that it's poorly designed.
    - If you find motivation to be lacking try to phrase it in terms of a problem that is able to be acted upon. Requesting similar things to what is being proposed be investigated in other languages, concerns of performance impact of a proposal to other parts of the language, or  discussing consistency with other semantics within the language are examples of these.
    - Understand that due to varied backgrounds and usages of the language, some proposals may not have desirability to an individual, this does not reduce motivation or desirability for other individuals. Keep feedback about motivation around the proposal itself rather than personal desirability or usage.
    - A variety of decisions are made due to constraints that might not be readily available by only visiting open issues. Be open to understanding constraints that apply to others that might not apply to your own decision making.
- We're all coming from different perspectives and have partial knowledge of the universe. Give your feedback from wherever you're at. For example, there is no need to dress up feedback in formal language if your thought process doesn't correspond to that.
- Whenever possible, give feedback ahead of a TC39 meeting in issues on the GitHub repository for the proposal.
- Search for existing issues which cover a topic before posting a new topic.
- It's helpful to give positive feedback, or feedback agreeing with a previous critique, as well as new points of critique.
- Feedback which is given in channels outside of GitHub and meeting discussions (for example, Twitter threads) is more likely to be lost.
- When in meetings, use the queue tool rather than interrupting the presentation to make a point. See [how-to-participate-in-meetings.md](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/master/how-to-participate-in-meetings.md) for details.

The champion group is responsible for carefully considering the sum of all feedback and making a recommendation to the committee taking this into account. Champions will not always be able to find absolute consensus among everyone who voices an opinion, but they should do their best to listen carefully and come to a balanced judgement.
