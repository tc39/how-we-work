# How to give helpful feedback

Online and in person at TC39 meetings, we're always giving feedback on proposals. There are some suggestions for making sure that your feedback is actionable and helpful.

- Follow the TC39 [Code of Conduct](https://tc39.github.io/code-of-conduct/) in all proposal feedback
- Keep feedback respectful, constructive and actionable.
- When you see a problem, explain the problem as much as possible. Proposing a solution can be helpful, but sometimes jumping to and insisting on a particular solution can be counter-productive.
- When you don't understand the motivation for a part of a proposal, one good strategy is to ask a question about it, rather than assuming that it's poorly designed.
- We're all coming from different perspectives and have partial knowledge of the universe. Give your feedback from wherever you're at. For example, there is no need to dress up feedback in formal language if your thought process doesn't correspond to that.
- Whenever possible, give feedback ahead of a TC39 meeting in issues on the GitHub repository for the proposal.
- Search for existing issues which cover a topic before posting a new topic.
- It's helpful to give positive feedback, or feedback agreeing with a previous critique, as well as new points of critique.
- Feedback which is given in channels outside of GitHub and meeting discussions (for example, Twitter threads) is more likely to be lost.
- When in meetings, use the queue tool rather than interrupting the presentation to make a point. See [how-to-participate-in-meetings.md](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/master/how-to-participate-in-meetings.md) for details.

The champion group is responsible for carefully considering the sum of all feedback and making a recommendation to the committee taking this into account. Champions will not always be able to find absolute consensus among everyone who voices an opinion, but they should do their best to listen carefully and come to a balanced judgement.
